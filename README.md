# Scatterplot_algorithm
The goal of this ongoing project is to develop a standardized scatterplot aesthetic in ggplot2, that relies on just a handful of variables that a user can easily edit, and declare, to quickly make scatterplots for several variable pairs using the same theme.

There remain many tasks yet to complete, including:
  (1) developing code to automatically adjust the x and y scales to an aesthetically appealing width (ideally 10 breaks on each side)
  (2) continuing to customize and tailor the ggplot graphics themselves
  (3) developing code to add the regression model information onto the graph at the appropriate coordinate (must be dynamic)
  
This script will continue to be updated as new changes are made to the R script
